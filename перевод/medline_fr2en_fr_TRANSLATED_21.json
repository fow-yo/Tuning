Although the specific prostate antigen has contributed massively to the identification at a curable stage for 25 years, it is simultaneously essential not to overtreat a cancer with a significant indolent tumour rate.", "In this controversial context, the randomized prospective study of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, and in particular its Swedish subpopulation, has validated the benefit of early detection over the past decade.", "Because of the variety of therapeutic options and the potential side effects of some of them, it is recommended that such detection be performed only in duly informed patients.", "SUMMARY:", "During the pandemic, preliminary results on the protective effect of tobacco on VOCID-19 were widely disseminated around the world.", "In this context, and in view of the public health issues related to this subject, an ad hoc multidisciplinary group has been established in response to requests from public health institutions.", "The key messages of this comment are as follows: 1) The crisis of VOCID-19 could lead to an increase in tobacco consumption and a decrease in access to care.", "As a result, smoking-related morbidity and mortality may increase in the coming months and years;", "2) Smoking and tobacco-related diseases are prognostic factors for serious forms of VOCID-19; and 3)

could generate individual counterproductive behaviours and be used for commercial purposes.", "SUMMARY:", "There is much evidence from in vitro animal and human studies that the Bacillary Calmette and Guerin (BCG) vaccine can epigenetically reprogram natural immunity and thus provide \"out-of-target\" protection against pathogens other than mycobacteria.", "This process was called \"trained immunity\".", "While recent ecological studies have suggested that there is an association between BCG use policies and the frequency or severity of VOCID-19 in different countries, the interpretation of their results is difficult.", "For this reason, a case-control study was undertaken in Quebec to test this hypothesis.", "Several Phase III clinical trials are underway, including one in Canada, to assess the effectiveness of BCG against SARS-CoV-2 infections (expected results in 2021).", "In the past, BCG has been widely used in Canada, but at present indications are limited to high-risk
